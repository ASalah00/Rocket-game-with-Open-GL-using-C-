1.In each gameplay, 25 asteroids are generated at random X positions and begin falling towards the space rocket
2. Each asteroid is assigned a random color (red, green, or blue)
3. The user should be able to move the space rocket using the mouse without dragging
4. A colored laser beam (red, green, or blue) shoots out the rocket, and the user can change the color of the beam using the "Spacebar"
5. The user can destroy asteroids by: Aligning the laser beam with the asteroid and selecting the same color as asteroid
6. When an asteroid is successfully destroyed, the score increases by one point
7. There is a time limit of 20 seconds, after which the "Time's Up" screen is displayed with the user's final score
8. The user can press on F1 to restart the game

Note that when the user restarts the game, the asteroids' X values are randomly generated once again.


Hint: 
Implement asteroid class to make asteroid objects. This can help make the program easier.

Watch the attached video to give you an idea of what is required. Your teams shall consist of groups of two.
